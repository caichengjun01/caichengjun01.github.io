I am currently a research fellow at City University of Hong Kong Dongguan Research Institute (CityU DGRI). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong in July 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Cong Wang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~congwang/) (IEEE Fellow), and obtained my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from Jinan University, Guangzhou, in July 2016. I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at [HKAIFT](https://hkaift.com/) from 2021 to 2022 and as a research assistant at City University of Hong Kong from 2016 to 2017.
